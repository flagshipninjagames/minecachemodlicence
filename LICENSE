Minecache Mods Licence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone Can Use These Mods, or any code contained within these mods, For Anything they Want as long as it does not include: Nuclear, Chemical, or Biological weapons unless permitted by law.

Do not take credit for any mods you didn't make becuase they were made after watching a youtube tutorial, so really you'd be better off making your own.

Please don't go off and make a mod that replaces the functionality of this one after reading the line above this becuase that would be dumb becuase this one is free

Everything That Is Avalible Free Today Will Always Be Avalible For Free

If you use any of our mods in a modpack then you don't need to give credit, but it would be nice :)

If you add anything or fix a bug then it would be nice to pass it back to the project, but you don't have to

We are in no way entitled to fix any bugs or add any new features for you

Do not redistribute any maps created by us, we (mainly inky becuase he's the only one that's made one) worked hard on these maps, thanks :)

Copying the config is fine, i'm not sure I can even stop you, I'm just making sure that you know it's OK, I copied the custommainmenu cfg becuase I don't know how it works

You can use these mods on servers that requires a subscription but you may not collect profits or donations of any kind from the distribution of features added to Minecraft by this software.

I forgot what I was going to put here

If you are feeling kind and left a nice review, feel free to post it in the comments of it's respective page on our website (minecache.wordpress.com)

Thankyou for reading the Licence. You are now one of the 5 people that have been bothered to read this. I bet you've read the Minecraft EULA too. Wait! Minecraft has an EULA!?
